JMXEval is a plugin for Nagios/NRPE which can query JMX attributes or return values of JMX operations

== Introduction

JMXEval is a nagios plugin that allows checking simple jmx attributes,
checking attributes in composite JMX objects, checking return values from JMX operations,
making multiple jmx checks using same jmx connection for quicker response times,
making simple computations using multiple JMX attributes to derive meaningful monitoring figures,
regular expression based monitoring value comparisons,
warning and critical warning levels on all monitoring values including computed values,
and customizable performance data.

== Setting Up

=== With Nagios/NRPE

To setup jmxeval with your Nagios/NRPE setup,

. Download the latest version's zip file
. Unpack the zip file
. Place the following files from the zip file to `libexec` directory under
  Nagios directory, or any other location you prefer to place Nagios plugins
         - `jmxeval-<version>.jar`
         - `check_jmxeval` (for Linux or any UNIX based platforms)
         - `check_jmxeval.bat` (for Windows)

Ensure `JAVA_HOME` environment property is set to a valid Java installation,
or change the `check_jmxeval` or `check_jmxeval.bat` to set the `JAVA_HOME` value.

Run the following command to make sure setup is complete

On Linux (or other UNIX based platforms)

//[source, role="console"]
//----
//$ <nagios-dir>/libexec/check_jmxeval
//----

//On Windows

//[source, role="console"]
//----
//c:/ <nagios-dir>/libexec/check_jmxeval.bat
//----

This should print the following on the screen.

[source, role="console"]
----
Syntax: check_jmxeval <filename> [--validate=true [--schema=x.x]]
----

== Configuring JMX

To query with JMXEval, you will have to ensure that the Java process that you intend to query
has JMX enabled. If its already configured, you can skip this section of the document, otherwise you
can setup JMX on any Java processes (Java 1.5+) as stated in the following link.


http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html#jmxagent


Make sure that you refer the correct version of documentation to determine how
to enable JMX, as they could be different, specially if you are still using
Java 1.4 which does not support JMX out-of-the-box.

Additionally, you can refer documentation related your Tomcat, Spring framework, etc.
to determine other ways enabling JMX and exposing more useful information related
to the application.

////
//Your first jmxeval check configuration
////
//Before getting in to details about all the checks that jmxeval can perform, lets start with a simple check which checks for the current thread count in a Java process.
////
//This check will include,
////
//    Initiating a JMX connection to a JMX enabled Java process, by authenticating itself with a given username and a password (without SSL)
//    Querying the ThreadCount on the java.lang:type=Threading MBean
//    Checking if the thread count is in the expected range
//    Including the thread count in performance data which Nagios could use to produce history graphs

To perform this check, first you will need to make sure that you have
configuration file that instructs JMXEval to perform this check. Following
is a sample configuration file you could use for this.

    <!--
      connect to Java process running on 'localhost' having JMX agent exposed on port '9010'
      using username 'myUser' and password 'myPassword'

//    <eval name="Threads">
////
//      <!--
//        query the JMX connection to get the attribute 'ThreadCount' from the JMX bean with object name
//        'java.lang:type=Threading' and assign the retrieved value to a variable named 'threadCount'
//       -->
               <query var="threadCount" objectName="java.lang:type=Threading" attribute="ThreadCount" />

               <!--
                 perform a check using the 'threadCount' variable to see if the value of the
                 variable is in the expected range.

                 if the value is equals to or is over 30 the check will result in a warning
                 status, where as if the value is equals to or is over 40 the check will result
                 in critical status.

                 the message displayed with the plugin output would be 'ThreadCount is
                 ${threadCount}' where the '${threadCount}' would be replaced with the
                 value of the variable.
               -->
               <check useVar="threadCount" warning="30" critical="40"
                      message="ThreadCount is ${threadCount}">

                <!--
                 the variable used in this check, in this instance 'threadCount', will be
                 included in the performance data produced from the plugin output.
                -->

//
//
//To get started, copy the content from the above sample, and place it in an <nagios-dir>/etc/jmxeval-threadcount.xml or any other location you prefer.
////
//Then make sure that you have a JMX enabled Java process is running on your computer (or any other computer that is accessible from yours), and the XML file is updated with the proper url, username and password for the connection. Also make sure that the java.lang:type=Threading MBean is exposed (usually its exposed on all Java processes) using JConsole or VisualVM, and if its not available, update the objectName and attribute to reflect another MBean that is available.
////
//Now to test if the jmxeval check works, execute the following command.
////
//<nagios-dir>/libexec/check_jmxeval <nagios-dir>/etc/jmxeval-threadcount.xml
////
//And it was successful, it should give a output similar to,
////
//JMXEval Threads OK - ThreadCount is 23 | threadCount=23;30;40 time=0.0s
////
//

== Configuration elements

//Let us look at each element and what attributes you can configure to implement your jmxeval check.
//<connection> element
////
//The <connection> element will initiate a JMX connection for querying for MBean attributes of executing JMX operations configured within the <connection> element. It supports JMX authentication using username and password, as secured JMX connections over SSL.
////
//Configuration attributes available on <connection> element.
////
//    url - JMX connection URL. This is a mandatory attribute.
//    username - Username for authentication.
//    password - Password for the given username.
//    ssl - Whether to use SSL for the connection.
////
//Here's a few example connection elements.
////
// Connection to a Java process running on localhost on port 9010, without authentication.
////
//<connection url="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9010/jmxrmi">
////
//Connection to a Java process running on localhost on port 9010, with authentication.
////
//<connection url="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9010/jmxrmi"
//    username="myUser" password="myPassword">
////
//Connection to a Java process running on host named webserver1.adahas.com on port 9010, with authentication and SSL.
////
//<connection url="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://webserver1.adahas.com:9010/jmxrmi"
//    username="myUser" password="myPassword" ssl="true">
////
//Connection to a Java process running on host named webserver1.adahas.com having JMX and JNDI services running on two different ports; JMX on port 9010 and 1099. Note that standard JMX configuration will ensure that both services are available on the same port, hence this type of URL will only be needed only if JNDI service has been specifically provided on a different port.
////
//<connection url="service:jmx:rmi://webserver1.adahas.com:9010/jndi/rmi://webserver1.adahas.com:1099/jmxrmi">
////
//
//<eval> element
////
//The <eval> element represents a single check. A check could comprise of <query>ing one or more JMX attributes, <exec>uting one or more JMX operations, performing mathematical <expr>ressions on the acquired values, and checking the values to be in defined warning and critical levels.
////
//Configuration attributes available on <eval> element.
////
//    name - Name of the check, which will be displayed in the plugin output. This is a mandatory attribute.
//    host - Regular expression to perfrom on the hostname of the host before executing the check. If the pattern does not match, the check will not be executed. This would be useful if you are using a common XML file to perform multiple checks, where some of them are not applicable for some hosts/
////
//A simple check named 'HeapMemory'
////
//<eval name="HeapMemory">
//   ...
//</eval>
////
//A check named 'CacheSize' which should only be performed on hosts where the host name begins with 'cache'
////
//<eval name="CacheSize" host="^cache.*">
//   ...
//</eval>
////
//
//<query> element
//<exec> element
//<expr> element
//<check> element
//<perf> element
//Validating your configuration file
//Setting variables via command line to be used in the configuration file
//Troubleshooting
//Examples
//Multiple simple attribute checks (Thread count check)
//Using composite attributes and mathematical expressions (Heap memory usage check)
//Regular expression based check (Tomcat version check)
